# nix-config
Own nixos configurations

# Purpose
This repository servers my own needs and should not be used verbatim.
You can look and get inspired about how I use nixOS.
This was made public for the sole purpose of sharing configurations and inspire others.

# Contents
Each folder will contain the configuration for one server/machine.
So every folder is going to be symlinked to /etc/nixos on a given system.
Secrets are encoded with the help of agenix.
I hide public IPs, domain names, and other information I deem sensitive.
